## Website colophon

This page outlines technical details about this website. You can learn more about the purpose and content of the website, as well as the author on the [About](/) page.

This site was built using a boring [static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev), written in a boring [template](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) [language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and served by boring [S3 compatible storage](https://min.io) behind a boring [reverse proxy](https://nginx.org/en/).

The three primary fonts I use are:

- [Sentient](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/sentient) (serif)
- [Clash Display](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/clash-display) (sans-serif)
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) (monospace)

Syntax highlighting is done by the great [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/), statically generated of course.

If you enjoy the site, consider to [giving me a word]({{ site.repo }}/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell) or [some love](https://github.com/sponsors/faultables) (my love language is words of affirmation and github sponsors btw).
