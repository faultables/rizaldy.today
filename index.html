<p>Hi, I'm Rizaldy. I am currently a Senior DevOps Engineer at a Data Infrastructure Company based in Jakarta, ID. There have been so many changes in my life, but a few things that have remained unchanged are my interests in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure Management</li>
<li>System Administration</li>
<li>Developer Experience</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to do software development profesionally since 2015, mostly web application development. Since the 2020s my deep interests has been in making software developers more productive &amp; happy while keeping systems up &amp; running, securely.</p>
<p>I will be happy to help solve problems in any organization in any industry with my expertise.</p>

<h2>Writings</h2>
<p>I love writing. Here are the 3 most recent posts:</p>

      </h3><p>So I just got my new Mac machine last week. It's just a small machine with 8 CPUs and 8 GB of memory. I've been thinking about buying one for a long time and now the time has come!</p>

      </h3><p>I don't archive data very often but when I do it must be for a very important one. On the other hand, I somewhat don't trust &quot;cloud&quot; providers and would avoid them as much as I can since my paranoid level is kinda high.</p>
